# Team-Profile-Generator
    
    ## Description
    We want to build an application that can generate team members based on their roles and provide relevant information.
    As a homework assignment for the UW Coding Bootcamp
    On our ever growing team, we want to use this information to dynamically track new team members and their relevant information.
    I now feel very confident with Node.js and how to get the files to read and generate a new file based on the data presented by the user.

    Install Node.js on your computer

    ## Usage
    To initiate the application, open up the integrated terminal in the application and type in <npm i> to install all of the relevant npm files in addition to Node.js.  Next, type in <node index.js> and you will be prompted for all of the relevant questions. Answer each prompt as you wish and then click "finish your team" and you will be generated the assosciated HTML.
